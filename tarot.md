I read tarot cards in my spare time.  I know it is a very weird hobby, but it is something I find to be very fun.  I do not actually believe that the cards have the ability to predict the future, but to those that actually do believe, I have proven to be a valuable resource.  That, or they are entirely terrified of the concept of my predicting people's future.
