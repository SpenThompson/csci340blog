Honestly, most of this lab was entirely new to me.  I've heard of [Ruby][Ruby] and the Command Line before, but I definitely had not had any experience with either prior to this.
I definitely struggled when I had to run the command that made the files within the directory.  To incorporate the list, I have included every part that with which I had a problem.  These include:
- Running commands on the terminal
- Installing [Jekyll][Jekyll]
- General Patience
The .gitignore file was set to be read-only and I was losing my mind trying to find out why the command was not working for me.
Now that I have thrown everything against the wall, everything makes sense to me.  I completely understand every part of this simply because I had to research why I was having problems to avoid asking for help.
I look forward to using Markdown more (hopefully) because it is insanely easy to use in comparison to all of the tags in HTML.  This was so much quicker to make rather than the constant typing for HTML.
