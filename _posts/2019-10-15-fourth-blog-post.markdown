Oh lordie, I REAALLLY do not want to use Laravel.  All of the other frameworks have their own amazing quirks and features that endear themselves to me, but Laravel scares me like nothing else.  If my team wants to choose Laravel, it will be the hill I die upon.

Having said that, I firmly believe that either Django or Ruby on Rails is the best framework for our sake.  Django's ease of use is super attractive, and having to hand off the site to Childcare Aware may be easier if we use something as popular as Django.  Ruby on Rails, on the other hand, has so many features that interest me that I feel like it could help us immensely in the future.  Either way, I firmly believe that we would do best to use either.
