To be blunt, it has been quite a while since I've been this frustrated about something.  I'm usually on the more calm and collected side, but this frustrated me to no end.  I started off trying to implement [Jasper][Jasper] as my theme, but as I tried to implement that, it justdid not work for me.  As for why, I'm not certain, but I can only assume that it was my own personal error that was causing it.  ![Frustrated Man](https://free-images.com/lg/6475/man_boy_laptop_cafe.jpg)
I eventually decided that I should go for [Long Haul][Long Haul] as my theme, mostly because I remembered that Dr. Goadrich had done his basic blog utilizing this theme, which meant to me that it was most likely the easiest.  I believe I was right to be honest.  There were very few moving parts to the installation here, whether it be because I understood it better, or it actually was easier.  Either way, I finally implemented it.
As for the image in the header, its a picture of a statice flower.  The statice represents remembrance, and I love it for that.  ![Statice](https://free-images.com/lg/a3c0/statice_sinuatum_blue_sea.jpg)
