This wasn't too frustrating (thank God this was a nice break).  100% this was one of the best labs simply because it was mostly stuff that I already knew how to do (the actual website making part not APIs I'm not that advanced).  The Kahn Academy tutorial was honestly a little unnecessary after a bit simply because I understood most from class.

The only frustrations Levi and I really ran into were the actual implementations with the APIs.  We each took one of our APIs and tried to understand them and then we continue from there.  We both misunderstood such simple parts of the dictionary that it took us several times of looking over the program to understand what was wrong.  After that, though, It was super exciting to see each of the different possibilities from our APIs.  (Especially the tacos).
