I certainly had some idea of what I was doing.  Not necessarily a lot of knowledge, but at least enough knowledge to get through this lab (or at least I hope).  I clearly understood some portions of this lab, and for others, was floundering like a fish out of water, but I digress.  For this lab, I assumed that the auction website was something akin to eBay.  While I have not used the site myself as a seller, I do know the requirements for a bidder, so I used that knowledge as the basis of my flowchart.  Starting with the bidders and thinking of the information that eBay used, I tried filling out as many as I could remember, then cut away the fat (i.e. contact info, passwords, etc.).  Then I made assumptions based upon the selling end of things by taking what the bidder sees on eBay and creating based upon that.  As for the rest, I used the information given to me from the lab itself.

As for the Vertabelo portion of the assignment, I have to admit that I was stumped. I had a terrible headache on the day that we discussed Vertabelo, so I really did not understand a good portion of how to utilize it.  Still, I gave it the ol' Hendrix try and pushed through what I did not understand and came up with at least a decent-looking and feeling version of the Schema.

I am not extremely happy about how the Schema turned out, to be frank.  It is messy and I am sure that I messed up here and there in a couple of places.  Nevertheless, I still think I accomplished a lot and am certainly the better for learning.
